  I am a PhD researcher at Drexel University using statistical and machine learning techniques to predict mental health and mortality
  outcomes in large datasets. Previously, I completed my undergraduate degree in Cognitive Science at the University of Pennsylvania with a concentration in Computation and 
  Cognition where I also used machine learning and natural language processing techniques for analyzing customer feedback on medical and consumer products. 

  My research interests lie in the predictive ability of Biological and Brain age which can be calculated using blood-based and brain imaging data. 
  I answer these questions using tools such as multilevel linear regression frameworks, neural nets, Bayesian network analysis, and natural
  language processing.

  I also have experience in providing product improvements and financial forecasting for pharmaceutical and technology leaders backed by data analytics. These insights have been used by business
  leaders at companies like Merck, Samsung, Dexcom, and Janssen Pharmaceuticals to provide effective product and drug launch.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>R</mark> and <mark>Python</mark>

        description: | 
          As a PhD intern at Merck, I led a team of four data scientists and business analysts to develop a comprehensive data table for machine learning cluster analysis, 
          specifically to forecast a new LDL-C drug. This project involved analyzing patient claims, financial, and biomarker data from 99 million patients 
          using Spark SQL, R, and Python. I presented our analytics to the internal VP, where I recommended targeted marketing strategies for the drug's upcoming 
          launch in both the US and global markets. Additionally, I collaborated with consultants from Accenture and McKinsey & Company to present our financial forecasts to top stakeholders.

          At Delve Inc., a product design consulting firm specializing in medical and consumer products, I analyzed consumer trends using machine learning models for 
          Samsung America for their Flip and Fold phones. This analysis was based on large-scale customer surveys, utilizing text-scraping and sentiment analysis techniques 
          in Python. Additionally, I designed and implemented a Natural Language Processing Customer Review Analyzer for Dexcom's G7 continuous glucose monitor, using tools like 
          BeautifulSoup and Docker, to investigate the underlying reasons for customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction.

          Data from the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study (PHACS)
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Designed a new advanced statistical framework to
          forecast mental health and mortality risks for children with PHIV over time in a large electronic health records (Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort
          Study). Briefly, this new algorithm incorporates the starting health condition of each child to inform future health outcomes. This method
          has been shown to outperform previous methods of predicting health outcomes using Biological Age.

          Developed a statistical model to incorporate both blood-based and grey matter volume to calculate both Biological and Brain Age which is used to predict multimorbidity. 
          This is the first paper to examine both biological and brain age as a predictor for multimorbidity.

          I worked as a consultant with the Center for Weight, Eating and Lifestyle Science (WELL) Center at Drexel and Modus Create LLC as a PhD consultant to develop
          a binge-eating prediction application for smartwatches. I suggested and implemented a personalized Natural Language Processing to detect which foods are more 
          likely to cause binge-eating episodes. I also used XGBoost to achieve above an 80% sensitivity rate to predict binge-eating episodes based on time of day, 
          the number of calories in the food, and past episodes.

          Conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis between the Dot-com bubble era (1998-2002) and the current AI bubble (2022-present) 
          using Python and financial data APIs. Analyzed stock performance, volatility, maximum drawdowns, and market capitalization metrics 
          for representative companies from both eras. The analysis revealed that while the AI era shows higher average returns (279% vs 186%), 
          it also demonstrates lower volatility (51% vs 67%) and less severe drawdowns compared to the Dot-com bubble. This project utilized 
          statistical methods including normalized price trajectories, rolling volatility calculations, and comparative risk-return analysis to 
          identify key differences between the two market periods.

          Developed a comprehensive equity research framework analyzing 20 companies across pharmaceutical and technology sectors. The project 
          implements multiple valuation methodologies including Comparable Company Analysis (Comps), Residual Income Model (RIM), and scenario-based 
          valuations. Utilized CAPM and Fama-French three-factor models to calculate expected returns, alpha, beta, and Sharpe ratios. Created 
          profitability and capital efficiency metrics including ROE, ROA, ROIC, and EBITDA margins. Built a portfolio stress testing dashboard 
          that evaluates portfolio performance under various scenarios including interest rate shocks and earnings surprises. The analysis generated 
          price targets, identified investment opportunities, and exported comprehensive reports to Excel for further analysis. This project demonstrates 
          proficiency in financial modeling, statistical analysis, and portfolio risk management.

          compared to both traditional banks and fintech peers. The report covers earnings momentum, technical analysis, peer comparisons, and comprehensive 
          risk assessment including macro/FX exposure, credit risk, regulatory considerations, and competitive dynamics in the Latin American financial 
          services market.
